# H4shL4mb
H4shL4mb is a cloud-native checksum verification service powered by AWS Lambda, Golang, and Pulumi. Whenever a file lands in an S3 bucket, H4shL4mb automatically computes its cryptographic hash (MD5, SHA-256, etc.), ensuring data integrity and authenticity. With Pulumi handling infrastructure as code, deployment is seamless, scalable, and fully automated.
